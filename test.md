## Game Overview

### Game Setup

1. Both players collect necessary components and setup their side of the play area.
   - Dice Screen
   - Health Tracker Card
   - Health Tracker Token
   - 5 Dice of the same color
   - Each player chooses their gladiator(s).
      - See [Game Modes](#game-modes) for more information.
2. Set the Health Tracker Token on the Health Tracker Card to match the starting Health value of the chosen gladiator.
3. Players both roll a single dice to see who attacks first.
   - The player with the higher roll gets to choose if they would like to attack or defend first.
   - The player that is attacking first receives the Attacker Token.
   - Re-roll ties until there is a winner.

### Game Phase Anatomy

Players will take turns attacking and defending until their opponent has been defeated. Using their abilities to help turn the tide of battle in their favor. The game is broken down into Turns and Rounds. A turn consists of one player rolling and playing their dice as the attacker while their opponent defends. A round consists of two of these turns, with players swapping roles in between each turn.

1. Round Maintenance
   - Any abilities that are defined as use per round have their count reset at this point.
2. Turn Maintenance
   - Any abilities that are defined as use per turn have their count reset at this point.
3. Roll Phase
    - Both players roll their dice and prepare for attack/defense.
4. Combat Phase
   - The attacker plays a dice by selectiong one from the pool and placing it in the middle where it is visible to the defender.
   - The defender plays a dice in response.
   - Damage is calulated and health is deducted. See 
   - Repeat this phase until the attacker runs out of dice to play.
5. Swap Roles
   - Players swap attack/defense roles and repeat the Turn Maintenance, Roll, and Combat phases as the opposite role.
6. Repeat
   - Once both players have attacked, return to the Round Maintenance phase and start again.
   - Attack and Defnese roles swap again.

### Attacking and Defending

During the combat phase the Attacking player will take one of their dice from behind their Dice Screen and place it in the middle of the play area where the defender can see it. The defender will then choose one of their own dice to place as their defense. Damage is resolved based on the placement of the pips (dots) on the dice. The attacker will continue to play their dice until they run out. EXAMPLE ATTACK RESOLUTION

<!-- TODO write up detailed description of damage resolution  -->

There are also two special rules involved in attacking:

- Perfect Block
  - When the defending player plays an identical dice to the attacking player it is considered a Perfect Block.
- Counterattack
  - When performing a Perfect Block, the defender can choose to make a counterattack. This can only be done once per combat phase unless otherwise modified by an ability.
  - When making a counterattack both players will re-roll the dice involved in the Perfect Block, with the defender being the one to make the attack.

### Using Abilities

Each Character has two abilities written on the card. Abilities all have three main components. Please read the [Abilities](#abilities) section in the Appendix for more information on each ability.

1. Reset Timeline
   - Any abilities that have a finite number of uses will define when the usage counter resets.
   - Some abilities will reset their usage count each turn, others each round, and yet others do not reset for the entire game.
   - Any abilitity that does not specifiy a finite number of uses does not have a limit on the number of times it can be used.
2. Usage Phase
   - Some abilities can only be used as a defender (shield), some as an attacker (crossed swords), and others may be used when both attacking and defending (shield and sword). This will be denoted by a marker on the ability.
   - Some abilities can only be used during certain phases of the game. These will be defined in the text of the ability.
3. Effect
   - All abilities modify the game in some manner. This effect will be listed on the card.
   - Expanded text, clarification, and suggested uses are listed in the [Abilities](#abilities) section in the Appendix.

### Game Modes
<!-- These are entirely made up as filler right now -->
Duel

- Each player selects a single gladiator from the deck. Whoever reduces the other players health to 0 first wins.

Tournament

- Each player is randomly dealt 5 cards from the deck. They will choose three to keep and two will be discarded.
- Players will play a game normally until a gladiator is defeated. When a gladiator is defeated:
  - The current round ends immediately, no further abilities may be activated.
  - The defated gladiator is removed from the field and replaced by another gladiator controled by their player.
  - Resume the game as normal.
- The game continues until a player has no gladiators left to play.
